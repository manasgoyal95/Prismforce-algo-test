Intuition:
1. Loop through each circle and check if Abhimanyu can skip that fight.
2. If he cannot skip, then check if he can recharge. Here I have considered that he takes the power of the enemy.
3. After recharging (if possible), Abhimanyu battles the enemy and loses the power equal to the enemy's power if his power is sufficient.
4.  If Abhimanyu's power is less than the enemy's power, he loses the battle. 
5. Only for circles 3 and 7, check if they regenerate and attack from behind in the next circle.
